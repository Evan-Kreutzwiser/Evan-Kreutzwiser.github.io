          <p>
            A custom forum built from scratch during the QWeb development sprint
            of winter 2023.
          </p>
          <p>
            I managed a team of 5 and worked as a full-stack developer and UI/UX
            designer. Starting with no previous web development experience I
            learned React.JS and web technologies in the span of a few weeks,
            quickly entering a position where I offered guidance and answered
            technical questions for the team.

          <h3>Iridium - Hobby OS</h3>
          <p>
            A long-running project with the goal of creating an entire operating
            system from scratch. The project is still in its early stages, but I
            have learned a great deal about low-level systems programing and the
            complexity of modern operating systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project has undergone multiple iterations, with old work
            rewritten as I study new concepts and come up with improved plans
            and design patterns. Over the course of multiple iterations, I have
            successfully gotten the CPU into 64-bit mode, created a physical
            memory allocator, interfaced with a keyboard, and scanned PCIe slots
            for connected devices.

          <h3>Dining Hall Discord Bot</h3>
          <p>
            A Discord bot that automatically posts the day's menus for the
            Queen's University dining halls, which was used regularly by my
            extended friend group throughout the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was built by reverse engineering the API used by the university's
            own dining website and formatting that data in a Discord-friendly
            manner.

          <h3>QWeb Web Development Sprint</h3>
          <p>Queen's University, Mar 2023</p>
          <p>
            Developed a forum website as part of a team, as described in the
            <a href="#projects">projects</a> list.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the project I worked many roles, gaining experience in
            full-stack development, team management, design, and managing a live
            deployment. We faced tight deadlines and interpersonal issues, but
            persevered and prepared a functioning and visually appealing
            minimum viable product that cleanly handled elements where we
            intended to add new features. Throughout the summer I am continuing
            to polish the website and incrementally add the features that didn't
            make the cut for the demo day.
